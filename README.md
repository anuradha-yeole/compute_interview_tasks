# compute_task
This GitHub repository is dedicated to the Machine Learning Committee Compute's interview tasks, which consist of two main phases:

Task 1: Data Preprocessing and Analysis

In Task 1, candidates are required to perform data preprocessing, including cleaning and feature engineering, followed by a comprehensive analysis of the dataset. The focus is on ensuring data quality and extracting meaningful insights.
Task 2: Logistic Regression Model

Task 2 builds upon the preprocessed data from Task 1. Candidates are challenged to construct a logistic regression model and assess its performance in a classification task.
